# StarSwift: High-Performance Barnes-Hut Stellar Simulation

Effortlessly navigate the cosmos with StarSwift's high-performance Barnes-Hut algorithm. Enhanced with quadtrees and recursive gravity calculations, this streamlined engine accurately models thousands of stars, guaranteeing an optimized celestial experience.

### General
- `Pause/Start`
	- This button allows users to toggle the simulation update cycle to allow them to view a particular system state.

- `Reset Galaxy`
	- Reset the system state to the initial galaxy configuration when the program began. Use this when the system becomes unstable.

- `Gravitational Strength`
	- Determines the mass of a star. Each star is assumed to have the same mass. Increasing this value increases the force of the interaction between neighboring stars creating local star clusters.

- `Max Star Velocity`
	- Determines the maximum velocity a star can travel preventing the system from becoming unstable due to large gravitational forces. Also allows users to reset the system state without needing to reset the entire program.

- `Theta Threshold`
	- This parameter is the core of the Barnes-hut algorithm. Theta determines the accuracy of the simulation. Setting $\theta = 0$ reduces the simulation to a naive n-body simulation of time complexity $O(n^2)$. Increasing this value gradually reduces the time complexity to $O(n)$ by sacrificing accuracy for speed. Increase this parameter to increase simulation speed.

- `Collision Softening`
	- Dampens the force between two stars thereby reducing the chance that a star is launched outside the system. We calculate acceleration by $a_{star} = \frac{m_{star}}{r^2+d_{soft}}$ where $d_{soft}$ is the softening parameter. This helps prevent velocities from becoming infinite when stars get too close to one another.

- `Galaxy Color`
	Change the base color of the galaxy.
	
- `Color Modes`
	- Change the method that determines the color of each star. Choose between three modes (Radial, Solid, Velocity).
	
		- **Radial**: Stars near the center of mass of the galaxy are white whereas stars far from the center of mass are closer to the `galaxy color`. This gives the illusion that the center of mass is at a higher temperature.
		- **Solid**: All stars are the same color as the galaxy color.
		- **Velocity**: Stars travelling at a higher velocity are white whereas stars travelling at low velocities are closer to the `galaxy color`.

### Vector Display
- `Show Velocity Vectors`
	- Enabling this option allows users to view the velocity vectors of all stars in the system represented by a white line.

- `Show Gravity Vectors`
	- Enabling this option allows users to view the gravity/acceleration vectors of all stars in the system represented by a white line.

### Stats
- `System Energy`
	- Shows the energy components of the system. Ideally, the kinetic and gravitational potential energies will always have equal magnitude but opposite sign or $U = -K$ assuming the system had very little total energy in the beginning. As the user changes the `Gravitational Strength` or `Max Star Velocity` they artificially introduce energy into the system and thus $U \neq -K$ in those scenarios.

## Features

- View stellar dynamics in real-time
- Tunable system parameters for experimentation
- View system variables such as velocity and acceleration in real-time
- View kinetic energy graph during system evolution
- Fullscreen mode

## Usage/Examples
Manually change starting parameters to observe different initial galaxy configurations.
```cpp
// Determine galaxy size and shape
const int NUM_STARS = 5000;
const int RADIUS = 300;
...
// Determines the shape of the galaxy, currently a perfect circle
std::uniform_real_distribution<double> dist_pos_y(-y_variance+height_middle, y_variance+height_middle);
```
