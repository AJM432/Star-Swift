## Features

- View stellar dynamics in real-time
- Tunable system parameters for experimentation
- View system variables such as velocity and acceleration in real-time
- View kinetic energy graph during system evolution
- Fullscreen mode

## Usage/Examples
Manually change starting parameters to observe different initial galaxy configurations.
```cpp
// Determine galaxy size and shape
const int NUM_STARS = 5000;
const int RADIUS = 300;
...
// Determines shape of the galaxy, currently a perfect circle
std::uniform_real_distribution<double> dist_pos_y(-y_variance+height_middle, y_variance+height_middle);
```
